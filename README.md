# Calculator

## DESCIRPTION 
this is a basic calculator you can use on a android device

## The following functionality is completed
* The user can press the number buttons to have a number appear on the calculator
* when a user hits a plus button for example the number stays the same until the user enters a new one
* the user then can enter a new one
* if the user presses the equals button after entering the new number it will run the equation
* if the user instead pushes another equation number it will do the previous equation then make a new one with the newly selected equation
* C button clears everything and sets it back to the original state
* +/- makes a number positive or negative
* % divides the number by a hundred and displays it at the top
* . turns the number into a decimal

## Extenions
* made so the calculator doesnt immeditaly always go into double unless the user selcets the deciaml button
